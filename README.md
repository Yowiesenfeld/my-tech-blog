# my-tech-blog

A large part of working in tech involves staying up to date by reading and writing about recent advancements and new technologies. 
I want to create a website where different coders can come to post blogs and comment on other people's blogs. 
Another reason why I want to create this site is to help coders build a sense of community and support each other.
